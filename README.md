# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains a simple implementation template for the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The goal is to provide a minimal starting point for experimenting with KNN for classification or regression tasks.

## Overview

KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm. Given a labeled dataset, predictions for unseen samples are made by locating the `k` closest points in the feature space and performing a majority vote (for classification) or averaging (for regression).

### Key Features

- Minimal code base intended for educational use.
- Ready to extend with your own dataset and preprocessing steps.
- Example usage with the popular `scikit-learn` library.

## Getting Started

These steps assume you have Python installed. If you want to run an example using `scikit-learn`, install the requirements and run the sample script.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you add dependencies
python example.py                # example script using scikit-learn
```

The example script demonstrates loading a toy dataset, splitting it into train and test sets, training a KNN model, and evaluating its accuracy.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── example.py       # demonstrates KNN with scikit-learn
├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies (optional)
└── README.md        # project documentation
```

You can extend `example.py` or create new modules to load your own dataset, perform preprocessing, tune the `k` value, and evaluate results.

## Basic Usage in Python

Below is a minimal example using `scikit-learn`:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Load dataset
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)

# Split into train and test data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create the KNN model with k=5
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```
